# How to use

#### ↖️ Click on the hypothesis/evidence labels to edit.

#### ⬅️ Drag sliders to adjust likelihoods.

This calculator is for analyzing how observed evidence should effect your beliefs between different hypotheses.


1. Put in your prior odds for your hypotheses. 

2. Record a piece of observed evidence by clicking the label and using the sliders.

3. Use the slider for each evidence + hypothesis pair to indicate how much you'd expect to see that evidence in worlds where that hypothesis is definitely true, as well as where ***all the evidence above*** has also been observed (this avoids double-counting evidence).

4. Read the posterior probabilites to see how much this evidence should update your beliefs!

Of course, this is all just a tool for helping you make your own beliefs consistent with the evidence reported. If you put in wacky priors, or omit significant evidence, there's no guarantee it will spit out a reasonable answer. It also can't help much if you didn't include the true hypothesis to begin with!
